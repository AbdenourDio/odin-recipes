        <h2>The Effortless Dessert Recipe From My Vintage Bisquick Cookbook</h2>
        <p>Impossible Pies are typically desserts that magically separate into layers in the oven, creating both its own crust and a filling. The addition of a baking mix like Bisquick gives the pie structure, so you don’t need to make a separate crust. The desserts, often enriched with buttermilk, coconut, or lemon, became popular in the 1970s, when they were featured on the back of Bisquick boxes.</p>
        <p>Impossible Brownie Pie is the fudgy cousin of the original. The one-bowl recipe taped inside by Bisquick cookbook calls for eggs, melted semi-sweet chocolate, Bisquick, brown sugar, granulated sugar, softened butter or margarine, and chopped nuts of your choice. The batter bakes in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes to produce a sweet brownie-pie hybrid.</p>
